          <h1>Hahow APP redesign</h1>
          <p>
            As an online learning enthusiast, I often evaluate educational apps. I redesigned one of them, Hahow, a
            mobile learning app, based on user research and usability test findings.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/projects/hahow APP/0_2D2V327LOnzAZExr.jpg" alt="" />

          <h2>Major usability issues</h2>
          <p>
            Hahow has its own video player to diplay their courses. Most of the controls on the player will be familiar
            to you if you have watched online videos before. However, the Hahow video player still lacks some features
            that users need.
          </p>

          <h3>Speed control</h3>
          <p>
            Some courses would be too difficult or too easy to some students and would need a speed control button to
            play slower or faster. However, it is not enabled in Hahow.
          </p>

          <h3>Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            Hahow decided to let the APP detect users' device and value internet connection environment, choosing the
            best resolution itself while playing the videos. However, sometimes the detection is not accurate or users
            are willing to wait some more time for high resolution. In this case, users still need the resolution
            control button to make the video play in the right resolution.
          </p>

          <h3>The nextÂ course</h3>
          <p>
            When a user finishes a course in full-screen mode and wants to play the next one, the user needs to turn off
            the full screen, choose the next course from the playlist, and turn on the full screen again.
          </p>

          <h3>Layout</h3>
          <p>
            During play, the play/pause, rewind/fast forward buttons and playback bar stay right in the bottom of the
            video. These controls and the half-transparent mask under them block users' view to subtitles. Users need
            subtitles to help them to decide when to stop rewind/fast. In addtion, users couldn't hide the control panel
            right after the control had shown by clicking the blank space.
          </p>

          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <li>make the control panel full screen</li>
          <li>lower opacity of the control panel background</li>
          <li>add speed and resolution controls</li>
          <li>add next course and playlist button</li>
          <li>zoom the play/pause, rewind/fast buttons</li>

          <h2>Redesign</h2>
          <h3>Scoping</h3>

          <p>
            As an illustration of my recommendation, I decided to start from the player because it is the central part
            of Hahow, and that redesigning it will help with the most usability issue.
          </p>

          <h3>Sketching out possibilities</h3>

          <p>
            I started from sketching out the wireframes and possible interactions, and evaluated each solution based on
            my understanding of the challenge.
          </p>

          <h3>Before and after</h3>
          <p>
            After redesign, it's a lot more easier to click play/pause, rewind/fast forward buttons. The background of
            the control panel has a lower opacity so that the users can see the subtitles through the panel background.
          </p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            I generated interaction maps, and conducted interviews, comparative analysis, heuristic evaluation,
            usability testings, and collected quantitative survey data. Below is a summary of the methods I used.
          </p>

          <h3>Interaction map</h3>
          <p>
            To gain a comprehensive understanding of the app flow, I first generated an interaction map to walk through
            all the interactions.
          </p>
          <h3>Interviews</h3>
          <p>I conducted interviews with 3 users to understand user needs and the context of use.</p>
          <h3>Google reviews</h3>
          <p>
            I collected a total of 70 google play reviews, 43 reviews valid, to understand users' opinions on the use
            and effect.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/projects/hahow APP/reviews.jpg" alt="" />
          <h3>Comparative analysis</h3>
          <p>
            To understand different desin patterns of players, I analyzed mainstream player in the world. This step
            served as an inspiration in my redesign of the app.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/projects/hahow APP/comparative analysis.jpg" alt="" />

          <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
          <p>Based on Nielsen's 10 usability heuristic rules, we consolidated 7 major usability findings.</p>
          <h3>Usability testing</h3>
          <p>
            To further validate the usability issues that prevent users from completing the core learning functions, we
            planned a set of tasks involving featured functions that have revealed potential usability problems in
            previous studies.
