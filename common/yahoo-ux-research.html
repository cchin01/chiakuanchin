          <h1>Yahoo Shopping UX Research</h1>
          <p>
            Yahoo shopping is an EC platform which scaled to over 17M visits a month. In 2020, I worked with UI/UX team, product team, marketing team, and sales team to deliver a better search experience and achieved 22% increase of conversion rate on category page.
          </p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <h3>Usability test</h3>
          <p>
            Observed 7 users and minuted the interview. Analyzed the context of use and transformed user needs to
            practical function or product features.
          </p>

          <h3>Why usability test?</h3>
          <p>We needed to observe what problems would users encounter in the process of searching product from the home page, and usability test is exactly the kind of experiment to figure out what issues might be in a certain task.</p>

          <h3>Why 7 users?</h3>
          <p>According to Nielsen Norman Group, one of the leading company of user research, the number of usability problems found in a usability test with n users is:</p>

          <p class="formula" >N（1-（1- L) <sup>n</sup>）</p>

          <p>N is the total number of usability problems in the design and L is the proportion of usability problems discovered while testing a single user. The typical value of L is 31%, averaged across a large number of projects that Nielsen Morman Group studied. Plotting the curve for L =31% gives the following result:</p>

          <img src="..//img/projects/yahoo search/user-testing-diminshing-returns-curve.gif" alt="">

          <div class="sp-m"></div>

          <p>It means the more users you interview, the less margin returns you could get. Our goal was to discover over 90% of user interface problems. According to the formula, we needed to test on average 6.46 users to discover 90% of given L (the occurrence of a problem) is 30%. So, 7 would be the mininum sample size. </p>

          <h3>What about the rest 10% usability problems?</h3>
          <p>Since the usability test has diminshing returns, it is better to distribute budget for other user testing across many small tests instead of blowing everything on a single, elaborate study.</p>
            

          <h3>Others</h3>
          <p>
            I collected data from various sources, including customer service, report form, google play reviews, forum,
            and so forth.Organized and analyed them to understand its flaws and potential improvements.
          </p>

          <h2>Highlights</h2>
          After the research, we found following major pain points.

          <h3>Filter (Web)</h3>
          <p>
            After expanding the filter menu and click any one of them, the web would auto-reload and the filter
            collapse. It would be very inconvient for those who want to select multiple options
          </p>

          <h3>Items hint (APP)</h3>
          <p>
            When users browse the search result page and scroll down, the APP would load the next 10 items every time
            until the last item is about to shown. The APP put all the items on the same page instead of using
            pagination. But without the pagination, the users couldn't expect how long it would take to scroll down to
            the very bottom. According to the research, most users had negative emotions when they couldn't expect the
            amount of rest items while scrolling down the search result page.
          </p>

          <h3>Category (APP & Web)</h3>
          <p>
            Part of product categories of Yahoo was aligned to sales team, and it was not intuitive enough to users. In
            addtion, the page layouts of different levels of categories are not consistent. Most interviewers were
            confused when they first time searched product by category system.
          </p>

          <h2>Variations</h2>
          <h3>Filter (Web)</h3>
          <p>
            It won't collapse every time the user click a single checkbox. You can select multiple values at one time
            and then click the collapse all.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/projects/yahoo search/filter.gif" alt="" />
          <div class="sp-m"></div>

          <h3>Items hint (APP)</h3>

          <img src="../img/projects/yahoo search/hint.gif" alt="" />
          <div class="img-description">Show the number of products below.</div>

          <div class="sp-s"></div>

          <div class="row"><img class="center-block" src="../img/projects/yahoo search/hint2.gif" alt="" /></div>
          <div class="img-description">half transparent background</div>

          <div class="sp-s"></div>

          <h3>Category (APP & Web)</h3>
          <p>
            We reconstructed category system by deleting seldom used name, renaming some of them according to user
            research and search volume, and organizing them in a more intuitive structure.
